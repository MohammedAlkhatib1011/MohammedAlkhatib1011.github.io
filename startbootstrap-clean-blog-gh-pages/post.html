                    <p>Industry Talk Reflection: Back on 14th November UTM JB offered us an Industrial Talk in TIS was an overview of ICT Jobs in Clarity Techworks. It was an amazing and well-organized event. During the Industrial Talk, it described the
                        world of ICT jobs in nowadays companies the primary focus of the talk was to provide an overview of the various job roles and career opportunities within the ICT sector, particularly as they exist in contemporary companies.</p>
                    <p>I gained from this industrial work that I must be different from everybody in everything, i have to have my own unique style. The Industrial Talk by Clarity Techworks at UTM JB was a remarkable event that offered valuable insights
                        into the ICT industry. It was a surprise in terms of understanding the different career paths in ICT and the importance of individuality in professional development. The presenters from Clarity Techworks were not just knowledgeable
                        but also inspiring, making the event a resounding success. As a participant, I left the talk with a renewed sense of purpose and a clearer vision of how to differentiate myself in my future career endeavors.</p>

                    <span class="caption text-muted">A screenshot of the industry talk</span>
                    <p>There seems to be little room for improvement, as the event was kinda flawless in its execution and impact, I don't think there is any improvement needed the representatives were super cool and helpful.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Poster</h2>
